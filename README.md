# Social-distancing-detection


**WHAT IS SOCIAL DISTANCING?**

Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Social distancing, also called **“physical distancing”** means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.

Social Distancing is the term that has taken the world by storm and is transforming the way we live.
The only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to maintain Social Distance.
Keeping a safe distance from each other is the ultimate way to prevent the spread of this disease.

**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

**AIM:**
This project detects where each person is in real-time, performs keypoint detection and returns a bounding box that turns red if the distance between two people is very close.

**LIBRARIES**

 - DETECTRON2
 - OPENCV
 - NUMPY
 - MATPLOTLIB


**DETECTRON2**


Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system
that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version,
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).
